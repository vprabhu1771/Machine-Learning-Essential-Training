Sure!
This is a very good question ‚Äî and also an **important clarification**:

> * Use a local open-source language model (like a small LLM).
> * Load and run that model yourself, for example using libraries like `transformers`.
> * Or train your own small model (which is advanced and resource intensive).

I‚Äôll explain the realistic way **using a local open-source model** (so it‚Äôs still all local, *but* you‚Äôll use Python and `transformers` to run it).
You won‚Äôt be calling any external API, and your code will run offline on your machine.

## üõ† **Step-by-step: Local Gen AI for C code in Python (no third-party API)**

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install transformers & torch

You *do* need these Python libraries ‚Äî they are open source, free, and local:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Choose a code generation model

Some small models you can run locally:

* `Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono` (for single-language code, including C)
* `Salesforce/codegen-350M-multi` (for multi-language code)
* `WizardCoder` (better, but much larger)

For demonstration, I‚Äôll use `Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono` (about 500MB).

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Write Python code to generate C code

Create `gen_c_local.py`:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

def generate_c_code(prompt, max_length=256):
    # Load model & tokenizer
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono")
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono")

    # Encode prompt
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7)

    # Decode to text
    generated_code = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    
    return generated_code

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_prompt = "/* Write a C program to calculate factorial of a number */\n"
    code = generate_c_code(user_prompt)
    print("Generated C code:\n")
    print(code)
```

> **Explanation**:
>
> * You give the model a prompt (can be a comment in C like `/* Write a C program to ... */`)
> * The model continues and generates the code
> * This runs 100% locally, no external API

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Run the script

```bash
python gen_c_local.py
```

It will print generated C code.

## ‚≠ê **Important notes**

* Running bigger models like `codegen-2B` or `WizardCoder` needs **a lot of RAM / GPU**.
* `codegen-350M-mono` is small; it can run on CPU but quality isn‚Äôt very high.
* For better quality you need bigger models (2B, 6B, 16B), but then you‚Äôll need a good GPU.
* This is still ‚Äúthird-party code‚Äù in the sense that you are using an open-source model, but there is **no API or external service**.

---

## ‚ö° **Advanced / next step**

If you really want to **train your own small Gen AI**:

* Collect C code samples
* Train a small language model (e.g. using GPT-2 architecture) on them with `transformers`
* That is quite advanced and resource-intensive

But running open-source models locally (as above) is the practical Gen AI approach.

‚úÖ I can help:

* Make a CLI
* Build a web UI
* Explain how to train your own small model

Just say **‚Äúyes‚Äù** and tell me what you want next! üöÄ
