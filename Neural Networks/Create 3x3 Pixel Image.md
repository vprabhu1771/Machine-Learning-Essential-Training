To create a 3x3 pixel image in Photoshop, follow these steps:

1. **Open Photoshop** and go to **File > New** to create a new document.
   
2. In the **New Document** dialog box, set the following:
   - **Width**: 3 pixels
   - **Height**: 3 pixels
   - **Resolution**: 72 pixels/inch (or adjust as needed)
   - Set the **Background Contents** to transparent or white, depending on your preference.

3. Click **Create**.

4. Zoom in to see the tiny 3x3 pixel grid by pressing **Ctrl + +** (Windows) or **Cmd + +** (Mac) multiple times.

5. Use the **Pencil Tool** (B) or the **Brush Tool** with a 1-pixel size to color the individual pixels.

Once you're done, you can save the file as needed!
